### **Component Connections**

1. **Motor Negative Terminal (PA7)**:
   - Connect the motor’s negative terminal to pin **PA7** on the STM32 board.

2. **Motor Positive Terminal (PA6)**:
   - Connect the motor’s positive terminal to pin **PA6** on the STM32 board.

3. **Switch (PA0)**:
   - Connect a button between pin **PA0** and the 3.3V supply (for example). When the button is pressed, pin **PA0** will be high (3.3V).

4. **Override Control (PA1)**:
   - Connect a button between pin **PA1** and the 3.3V supply. This button can activate or deactivate motor control, depending on the system state.

5. **Motion Sensor (PA2)**:
   - Connect the motion sensor to pin **PA2**. The sensor might have a digital output that connects directly to **PA2**.

6. **Fire Sensor (PA3)**:
   - Connect the fire sensor to pin **PA3**. The sensor can have either a digital or analog output, depending on the type of sensor.

7. **Alarm (PA8)**:
   - Connect an alarm output (such as a siren or warning light) to pin **PA8**. When an event (like a fire) is detected, pin **PA8** will be activated to turn on the alarm.

8. **LED (PB8)**:
   - Connect an LED between pin **PB8** and ground, ensuring you use an appropriate current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220Ω to 330Ω).

9. **Fan (PB9)**:
   - Connect the fan between pin **PB9** and ground or supply, depending on the fan type (ensure it’s compatible with control by 3.3V).

10. **Potentiometer (ADC Channel 4, PA4)**:
    - Connect the potentiometer between pin **PA4** (ADC4) and ground (with the wiper connected to pin **PA4**). Ensure the potentiometer is also connected to the 3.3V supply.

11. **Temperature Sensor (ADC Channel 5, PA5)**:
    - Connect the temperature sensor between pin **PA5** (ADC5) and ground, with the sensor’s output signal connected to pin **PA5**.

12. **UART (PA9 and PA10)**:
    - Connect pin **PA9 (TX)** to a device that receives data (such as a UART terminal or another microcontroller).
    - Connect pin **PA10 (RX)** to a device that sends data (such as a UART terminal or microcontroller).

### **Summary of Connections**

- **PA7** → Motor negative terminal
- **PA6** → Motor positive terminal
- **PA0** → Switch
- **PA1** → Override control (button)
- **PA2** → Motion sensor
- **PA3** → Fire sensor
- **PA8** → Alarm
- **PB8** → LED (with resistor)
- **PB9** → Fan
- **PA4** → Potentiometer (ADC4)
- **PA5** → Temperature sensor (ADC5)
- **PA9 (TX)** → UART transmit device
- **PA10 (RX)** → UART receive device

These are the necessary connections between the STM32 pins and the hardware devices. Make sure the power supplies for each component are correct (3.3V or 5V as needed), and use current-limiting resistors where necessary, such as for the LED.
